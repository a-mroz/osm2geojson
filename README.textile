h1. Introduction

Osm2geojson is a little project that utilizes several of my other github projects to convert open streetmap xml to a more
usable, geojson like format.


h1. Why and How?

The problem with the osm xml is that it is basically a database dump of the three tables they have for nodes, ways, and relations. Most interesting applications probably require these tables to be joined. 

This project merges the three into json blobs that have all the relevant information embedded. It's similar to loading everything in a database and then doing a gigantic join and then converting the output. The advantage of this approach is that it doesn't require a database, or an index and instead simply works by sorting and merging files. 

h1. Installation and use

This project utilizes a few of my other github projects. Prebuilt binaries for those projects can be downloaded from my private maven repository here: http://www.jillesvangurp.com/2013/02/27/maven-and-my-github-projects/. Alternatively, you can check them out manually and mvn clean install them yourself.

After setting this up, you should be able to run mvn clean install on this project. It will compile and then put some libraries in target/lib. These are needed to run the osmjoin.sh script. Alternatively, you can run this from your IDE. 

Make sure to assign enough heap to fit the bucket size (constant in the source code, defaults to 1M). Make sure you have enough disk space. OSM is a big data set.
